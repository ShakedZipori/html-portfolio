<h3>How's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
    Howl's moving castle is a movie produced by my favorite director:<br />
    Hayao Miyazaki - the owner of Studio Ghibli.<br />
    This movie is my favorite because it has it all : romance,<br />
    fantasy, many plot twists and a very happy ending.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>

<p>
    Another master piece from Studio Ghibli. I like this movie because<br />
    the art is amazing, the fantasy is all over the place and the pplot <br />
    take some realy interesting twists. Also, has a very good ending.

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>
    Avatar is a fantasy movie I started watching 10 years ago, when the first <br />
    movie in the series came out. This movie has magnificent technology involved <br />
    in order to deliver some high end effect and create a "realistic" <br />
    fantasy world. This movie touched me because it shown mankind's bad <br />
    bad influence on the world's nature, and it's continious colture <br />
    of Consumerism.
